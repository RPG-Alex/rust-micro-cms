# rust-micro-cms

## Purpose

This project's purpose is to create an easily deployable website CMS, with a complete backend and frontend, ultimately with a "What you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) or similar input for ease of posting.

### Goals

Ultimately this project is a learning project, to help understand how Rust can be used (and possibly not used). But the goal for this project is create a rich contnet management system that someone could simply add the binaries to their desired server environment and then access and configure their installation, much like wordpress or other popular content management systems, through a browser client. 

The project is meant to have a small footprint, and hopefully offer a more reliable and secure CMS solution, with less overall logic and complexity.

## Features:
[ ] Frontend built with Rust
	[ ] Browser based input for new posts
	[ ] Update, delete posts through browser
	[ ] Add media to posts 
[ ] Backend build with Rust
[ ] Database Management System

### Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project that is great! I am doing this to learn Rust and welcome anyone else doing the same or anyone that thinks a solution like this is something they would like to see happen!
